# Adaptive Learning Tool

A little side project I thought would be fun to put together. Questions are prescribed based on the topics I need to work on most. If the tool sees I have an understanding of the topic, it offers fewer questions on that topic and more questions from topics I need to work on. Similar to what I believe the functionality of Khan Academy is and U.S. MAPS testing in elementary schools.

A cool application I could use right now and an awesome chance to explore how intelligent software is revolutionizing education. 

Beta version will use problems from Calculus Eighth Edition by James Stewart. Specifically, chapter 7 on techniques of integration. Or Essential Calculus Skills workbook. I'll start with the integrals (maybe appendices too) since those are what I need to work on.

This makes organizing the problems straightforward since each section covers a particular technique of integration and I can assume that the later exercises are more difficult than the earlier ones. So I need to extract the problems from this chapter and the solutions from back of the book.
